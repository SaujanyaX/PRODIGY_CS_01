# PRODIGY_CS_01

This is the initial assignment I received during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. 
It is a Python program that utilizes a basic encryption technique. 
The user needs to provide a shift value for encoding or decoding. 
This Python script secures or restores a message using the Caesar Cipher Algorithm.
